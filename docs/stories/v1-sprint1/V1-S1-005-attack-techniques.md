# Add 20 Attack Techniques

**ID:** V1-S1-005
**Epic:** Mockup Data Expansion
**Priority:** P1
**Size:** M (2 hours)
**Sprint:** V1 Sprint 1 - Day 1

## User Story
As a cybersecurity student,
I want CyBuddy to explain attack techniques and methodologies,
So that I can understand offensive security approaches.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Add 20 attack technique entries
- [x] Cover categories:
  - Active Directory (5 techniques)
  - Web application (5 techniques)
  - Privilege escalation (5 techniques)
  - Network attacks (5 techniques)
- [x] Each entry includes:
  - Technique name
  - Description (beginner-friendly)
  - Step-by-step methodology
  - Tools used
  - Detection/mitigation tips
- [x] ‚ùå NO MITRE ATT&CK IDs (removed for v1 simplicity)
- [x] No duplicates

## Techniques to Add (20 total)

### Active Directory (5)
1. Kerberoasting
2. Pass-the-Hash (PtH)
3. Pass-the-Ticket (PtT)
4. Golden Ticket attack
5. DCSync attack

### Web Application (5)
6. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
7. XML External Entity (XXE)
8. Insecure Deserialization
9. Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)
10. HTTP Request Smuggling

### Privilege Escalation (5)
11. SUID binary exploitation
12. Sudo misconfigurations
13. Kernel exploits
14. Windows token impersonation
15. DLL hijacking

### Network Attacks (5)
16. ARP spoofing/poisoning
17. DNS spoofing
18. VLAN hopping
19. IPv6 MITM attacks
20. SMB relay attacks

## Technical Notes

### Data Structure (SIMPLIFIED - NO MITRE)
```python
{
    "name": "Kerberoasting",
    "category": "active_directory_attack",
    "description": "Technique to extract service account credentials by requesting TGS tickets and cracking them offline",
    "methodology": [
        "1. Enumerate service accounts with SPNs",
        "2. Request TGS tickets for target services",
        "3. Extract tickets and crack offline",
        "4. Use cracked credentials for lateral movement"
    ],
    "tools": ["Rubeus", "Impacket", "Invoke-Kerberoast", "hashcat"],
    "commands": [
        "# Using Rubeus",
        "Rubeus.exe kerberoast /outfile:tickets.txt",
        "# Crack with hashcat",
        "hashcat -m 13100 tickets.txt wordlist.txt"
    ],
    "detection": [
        "Monitor for unusual TGS ticket requests",
        "Alert on abnormal service account activity"
    ],
    "mitigation": [
        "Use strong service account passwords (25+ chars)",
        "Enable AES encryption for Kerberos"
    ],
    "related_techniques": ["Pass-the-Ticket", "AS-REP Roasting"]
}
```

**Note:** MITRE ATT&CK IDs removed for v1 simplicity. Can be added in v1.1 or v2 for power users.

### File Location
- Update: `src/secbuddy/data/mockup_data.py`
- Or: `src/secbuddy/data/techniques/attack_techniques.json`

## Definition of Done
- [ ] 20 techniques added
- [ ] All fields complete (no MITRE IDs needed)
- [ ] Beginner-friendly descriptions
- [ ] Test: `cybuddy explain "kerberoasting"`
- [ ] Git commit: "feat: add 20 attack techniques (simplified)"

## Time Estimate Breakdown
- Research techniques: 30 mins
- Write descriptions: 70 mins (simplified, no MITRE lookup)
- Format and validate: 15 mins
- Testing: 5 mins

**Total: 2 hours**

---

**Note:** V1 focuses on simplicity. MITRE ATT&CK IDs can be added in v1.1 or v2 for enterprise/power users.
